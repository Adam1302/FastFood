RESTAURANT
	- First, read through notes again to find design ideas
		- Decorator Pattern: Pizza
		- Factory Method: drink (and maybe pizza) sizes, sushi roll, etc.
		- "Has a" : aggregation (the menu 'has a' pizza)
		- All items inherit from superclass Item (see chess superclass Piece)
			- It'll have a name, lone price field
			- Maybe have categories inheriting from Item (ex. Drinks, Main (will have combo price field), Sides)
				- Make all these pure abstract (via constructor)
		- MVC
			- Model: Menu itself
			- View: how we print it
			- Controller: ordering
		- Lone price, combo price
		- Store order in a vector?
		- Have class for each object, and store (const?) objects for the menu in a vector
			- Output operator overload to display items on a menu 
			- Start with Pizza (using decorator)'=
			- Might need Big 5, later on down the line (ex. Reorder last meal)
			- 
		- Extra Features
			- Include promotions based on current day!
			- Static fields for total orders or inventory?
			- Create a STL map that stores people's last orders
			- RAII
	- Draw UML
	- Setup VSCode
	- Start Git project:
		- Upload to GitHub, then work on it using branches...
